# Sign_Language_Detection
- A detection system for the **American Sign Language (ASL)** was built using `Inception V3 model`. 

- This project aims to enable easy communication of deaf and mute people with the normal people.

- Using a camera, we can capture the sign shown by deaf/mute people which will be decoded.

- The interpreted sign will displayed to the other person with whom they are communicating.

- The model is trained for the **English Alphabet**. This can be further extended to numbers and simple phrases used in a day-to-day basis.
